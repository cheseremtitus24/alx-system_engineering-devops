trap "rm ~/tmp/* 2> /dev/null; exit" 0
This command has two arguments: a command to be executed and a signal number from the
operating system.
 The command rm ~/tmp/* 2> /dev/null; exit deletes everything in the
userâ€™s tmp directory, redirects the error output of the rm command to the null device (so it
does not appear on the screen), and issues an exit command to terminate the shell.
 The signal specified is 0, which is the operating system signal generated when a shell script is exited. 
 So,if this sample command is part of a script file, it causes the specified rm command to execute
when signal 0 is sent by the operating system.

To list System Signals use $ trap -l
