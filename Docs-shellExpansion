### Tilde Expansion
echo ~
*When username is provided it expands to show the user's home directory*
echo ~username

### Arithmetic Expansion (No support for Decimals)
** Arithmetic operands and operators must be enclosed within double outer quotes for it to be evaluated.
echo $(( (15**2)*2 ))

### Brace Expansion preamble{..}postscript
mkdir Hello_world_{1..5}_doc
mkdir Hello_world_{1,2,3}_doc

### Command Substitution
** Important when you want to store the results of a command to a variable **
result=$(which ls); OR result=`which ls`;
echo "$result";

### Quoting
** Can be utilized in order prevent unwanted parameter expansions of special characters e.g [~,&]**

#### Double Quotes
Exceptions that are not expanded are [`,$,\] - *back-quote,dollar sign, backslash*
Allows for : *Parameter Expansion, arithmetic expansion and command substitution*
Benefit is that Word-substitution is suppressed which involves removing repeated line feed characters.[spaces,tabs,newline]
echo $(cal)
echo "$(cal)"
