1. To redirect an entire domain to a new site:
Redirect 301 / http://www.example.com/
Replace the example domain with your new redirect destination. This will 301 redirect every page on your site to the corresponding URL on the target domain.

2. To redirect a single page
Redirect 301 /oldpage/ http://www.example.com/newpage/
You can use this redirect across different domains, or on your own site.
3. Using Apache mod_rewrite
You can also use Apache mod_rewrite in your .htaccess file for more flexible redirection. For example, here's the code you'd use to redirect from a non-www to a www subdomain.

RewriteEngine on
RewriteBase /
rewritecond %{http_host} ^domain.com [nc]
rewriterule ^(.*)$ http://www.domain.com/$1 [r=301,nc]

4. PHP redirect
Here is an example of implementing a 301 redirect using PHP:

<?php
header("Location: https://www.example.com/", true, 301);
exit();
?>

5. JS- Redirect
<script type="text/javascript">
    function redirect1(){
        window.location = "http://www.example.com/new-url/"  
	}   
	setTimeout('redirect1()', 5000);   
</script>
