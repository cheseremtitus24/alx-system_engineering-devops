let "n++"          # let "++n"  also works.

----------------------------------Variables Comparison----------------------------------

integer comparison

-eq
is equal to

if [ "$a" -eq "$b" ]

-ne
is not equal to

if [ "$a" -ne "$b" ]

-gt
is greater than

if [ "$a" -gt "$b" ]

-ge
is greater than or equal to

if [ "$a" -ge "$b" ]

-lt
is less than

if [ "$a" -lt "$b" ]

-le
is less than or equal to

if [ "$a" -le "$b" ]

<
is less than (within double parentheses)

(("$a" < "$b"))

<=
is less than or equal to (within double parentheses)

(("$a" <= "$b"))

>
is greater than (within double parentheses)

(("$a" > "$b"))

>=
is greater than or equal to (within double parentheses)

(("$a" >= "$b"))



---------------------------------- End of Integer Variable Comparison----------------------------------

----------------------------------String Comparison----------------------------------
=

is equal to

if [ "$a" = "$b" ]
---------------------
==
is equal to

if [ "$a" == "$b" ]
-------------------------------------------------------------
The == comparison operator behaves differently within a double-brackets test than within single brackets.
[[ $a == z* ]]   # True if $a starts with an "z" (pattern matching).
[[ $a == "z*" ]] # True if $a is equal to z* (literal matching).
-------------------------------------------------------------

!=
is not equal to

if [ "$a" != "$b" ]
---------------------------------------------------------
<
is less than, in ASCII alphabetical order

if [[ "$a" < "$b" ]]
------------------------------------------------------
>
is greater than, in ASCII alphabetical order

if [[ "$a" > "$b" ]]
--------------------------------------------
-z
	string is null, that is, has zero length
cheserem@cheserem:~$ String=''   # Zero-length ("null") string variable.

if [ -z "$String" ]
then
  echo "\$String is null."
else
  echo "\$String is NOT null."
fi     # $String is null.
$String is null.

----------------------------------------------------------
-n
string is not null.

Caution	
The -n test requires that the string be quoted within the test brackets. Using an unquoted string with ! -z, or even just the unquoted string alone within test brackets (see Example 7-6) normally works, however, this is an unsafe practice. Always quote a tested string. [1]



============ Example Bash =================
cheserem@cheserem:~$ if [ -n "$string1" ]  # This time, $string1 is quoted.
then
  echo "String \"string1\" is not null."
else  
  echo "String \"string1\" is null."
fi                    # Quote strings within test brackets!
String "string1" is null.
cheserem@cheserem:~$ $string1=hello
bash: =hello: command not found
cheserem@cheserem:~$ string1=hello
cheserem@cheserem:~$ if [ -n "$string1" ]  # This time, $string1 is quoted.
then
  echo "String \"string1\" is not null."
else  
  echo "String \"string1\" is null."
fi                    # Quote strings within test brackets!
String "string1" is not null.
================ End Example null test =======================

Returns true if 
-e 
	file exists
-a
	file exists
	This is identical in effect to -e. It has been "deprecated" & its use is discouraged

-f
	file is a regular file (not a directory or device file)
-s
	file is not zero size
-d 
	file is a directory
-b
	file is a block device
-c 
	file is a character device

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ end of script @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@


-h
	file is a symbolic link

-L
	file is a symbolic link

-S
	file is a socket
	
-t
	file (descriptor) is associated with a terminal device

	This test option may be used to check whether the stdin [ -t 0 ] or stdout [ -t 1 ] in a given script is a terminal.
	
-r
	file has read permission (for the user running the test)

-w
	file has write permission (for the user running the test)

-x
	file has execute permission (for the user running the test)
	
-g
	set-group-id (sgid) flag set on file or directory
	If a directory has the sgid flag set, then a file created within that 		directory belongs to the group that owns the directory, not necessarily 	to the group of the user who created the file. This may be useful for a 	directory shared by a workgroup.
	
-u

	set-user-id (suid) flag set on file

	A binary owned by root with set-user-id flag set runs with root privileges, even when an ordinary user invokes it. [2] This is 	useful for executables (such as 	pppd and cdrecord) that need to access 	system hardware. Lacking the suid flag, these binaries could not be invoked by a non-root user.

	      -rwsr-xr-t    1 root       178236 Oct  2  2000 /usr/sbin/pppd
	      
	A file with the suid flag set shows an s in its permissions.
	
-k
	sticky bit set

	Commonly known as the sticky bit, the save-text-mode flag is a special 	type of file permission. If a file has this flag set, that file will be kept in cache 		memory, for quicker access. [3] If set on a directory, it restricts write permission. Setting the sticky bit adds a t to the permissions on the file or directory 		listing. This restricts altering or deleting specific files in that directory to the owner of those files.

	      drwxrwxrwt    7 root         1024 May 19 21:26 tmp/
	      
	If a user does not own a directory that has the sticky bit set, but has write permission in that directory, she can only delete those files that she owns in it. 	This keeps users from inadvertently overwriting or deleting each other's files in a publicly accessible directory, such as /tmp. (The owner of the directory or 		root can, of course, delete or rename files there.)


-O
	you are owner of file

-G
	group-id of file same as yours

-N
	file modified since it was last read
	
f1 -nt f2
	file f1 is newer than f2
f1 -ot f2
	file f1 is older than f2
f1 -ef f2
	files f1 and f2 are hard links to the same file
!
	"not" -- reverses the sense of the tests above (returns true if condition absent).

__________________________ Magic of the test command utility ____________________________________________________

# Dissection 
-d tests for the existence of a specific directory
-e tests for the existence of a file
-r determines if the file has read permission
-s determines if the file has some type of contents (is not empty)
-w determines if the file has write permission
-x determines if the file is executable
-nt compares the first file in the argument with the second file to determine if the first file
is newer
-ot compares the first file in the argument with the second file to determine if the first file
is older
-eq compares two integers to determine if they are equal
! determines if an expression is false
stringa = stringb determines if two strings are equal
